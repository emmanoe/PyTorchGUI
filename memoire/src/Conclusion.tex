\subsection{The project}
This project was interesting for many reasons. It made us work on many part of the development of a modern application. In fact, we had to work on the designing of graphical interface, and linking it to a model, which calls an already existing and complex application.
This made us learn a lot of things about making graphical interfaces, but also things on the very complex and modern subject of deep learning.

\subsection{Difficult parts}

The complexity of this project was also what made it very challenging for us. In fact, it took us a lot of time to understand clearly what were the needs and requirements, and most importantly to understand the subject of deep learning itself. This made us take a long time to organise our architecture, and consequently to start to code.
